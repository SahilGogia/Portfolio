      Welcome to my Co-op work term report. In this report, I will be discussing
      my experiences, learnings, goals I completed, challenges that I faced, and
      the cool stuff that I did during my work term. This was my first work term
      and also this was the first time I ever had a tech job so this work term
      had a very positive impact on me and taught me a lot about the software
      industry. Being a computer science major this experience will play a key
      part in how I understand major workflows in the tech industry.

      <b>EMPLOYER</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I was lucky enough to get a co-op position at Tulip Retail this fall.
      Tulip is a SaaS-based company and its main focus is to transform and have
      a positive impact on the retail world using its technology. Tulip was
      founded in 2013 and since then the company has seen massive success. The
      software teams at Tulip consist of all sorts of smart people with
      different roles and backgrounds like Web Developers, IOS Developers,
      Quality Assurance engineers, etc. Development plays a key role at Tulip as
      their products work seamlessly on IOS devices and are also interconnected
      to their internal softwares which are web-based this allows the retailers
      to unlock their true potential and customers to have the best retail
      experience. These ultimate functionality products have impressed a lot of
      leading retailers like COACH, Tiffany & Co., JIMMY CHOO, etc. Tulip

      <b>JOB DESCRIPTION</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      This fall I got the opportunity to work as a Test Automation Developer at
      Tulip Retail. The first few weeks of my co-op were for my training where I
      learned about different strategies and the software which the QA team at
      tulip uses in order to test the new features. During my training I got
      knowledge about the concepts of unit testing, smoke testing, regression
      testing, UI testing, integration testing, and API testing using postman
      then I learned about the different types of HTTP request methods like GET,
      POST, DELETE, PUT after that I also got familiar with Azure DevOps Server
      which made it very easy for me to understand the entire application
      lifecycle. Once all this was done I got involved in the automation part of
      my job. I learned about the appium framework and CodeceptJS UI testing
      framework so that I can develop UI automation tests and improve the
      current tests. Once my training was done I was working with my mentor
      closely on the Clienteling app. The Clienteling app by Tulip plays an
      important role in bringing the customers and brands closer by providing
      the customers with a tailored customer experience and also allows the
      brands to better understand their customers which benefits both parties.
      It was the biggest and a very major project that I worked on. I was
      working closely with 2 IOS developers and a front-end developer to
      understand what the new features will be and how they will be working and
      integrated together. I had to constantly plan the test cases beforehand
      because of the complexity of the features and on-spot planning could have
      led to some unfound bugs and other issues. As the new features were being
      added the UI constantly changed which affected the UI selectors of the app
      on which the automation relied on, so along with my colleagues I had to
      work on the automation scripts regularly in order to modify the code to
      allow the test suites to run seamlessly every day reducing a manual
      regression task for the QA team. Two very interesting things that happened
      with me were that after some time my mentor realized that I was capable
      enough of being the only QA in a brand's development team allowing other
      QAs to take up other tasks and speed up the workflow. So for more than 2
      months, I was the only person who everyone relied upon before releasing
      the feature and one mistake by me could have caused unexpected feature
      behaviors due to some missed bug and product delivery delays which could
      have affected the business. I was also a part of the company’s co-op
      hiring process for the next work term which gave me an insight into how
      the new employees are hired and what all are the main qualities that are
      the most valued and how to properly structure a resume. For this job, at
      the very start, I had to be very detail-oriented and have some kind of
      knowledge about software testing along with some development and version
      control experiences which I learned while doing my university assignments
      and while talking to professors and the TAs during the classes and labs.
      Acquiring the most appropriate skills for this job was covered during the
      training as a majority of the crucial testing concepts and frameworks
      could only be learned while working with large-scale systems and software.

    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #e73269; font-size: 40px">
      <b>GOALS</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      Before starting my work term I had set a few goals in my mind which I
      wanted to achieve by the end of my work term. These goals allowed me to
      work hard and be a better learner and employee by the end of my work term.
      Here are my goals for this work term and how I achieved these goals.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #e73269; font-size: 27px">
      GOAL 1: LITERACY - Technological Literacy
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I wanted to learn about API testing and automation testing because that
      would help me to learn more about deep QA concepts which would allow me to
      become a better software tester in the future.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Action Plan:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I made sure that I read all the reading material regarding testing
      concepts and testing softwares given by my supervisor. I was very
      attentive during my training process and made sure to write down all the
      important points and tips that my supervisor gave me. I kept exploring the
      softwares to better understand them.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Measure of success:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I can think, generate and automate the test cases end to end and was able
      to make sure that the testing reports were accurately reported along with
      full API testing using postman software without anyone's help by the end
      of the work term which I think is a success for me.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #e73269; font-size: 27px">
      GOAL 2: CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Problem Solving
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I wanted to improve my thinking process about how I used to tackle and
      solve real-world problems which would help me to overcome challenging
      technical tasks in the most efficient way. This had a positive impact on
      my life and career.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Action Plan:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I made sure to attend developer meetings and QA meetings which helped me
      to understand how my seniors were thinking about approaching problems and
      I tried to apply the same thinking process while I was writing test cases
      for API testing and noticed how it improved my work.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Measure of success:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      Now when I see complex software I am able to think of all the possible
      test cases and solve other testing related problems without spending a lot
      of time or taking help from others and I am also able to automate them
      most efficiently while covering the edge cases. This is a huge
      accomplishment for me.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #e73269; font-size: 27px">
      GOAL 3: COMMUNICATING - Oral Communication
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I wanted to work on how I express myself and convey my words to other
      people. I think that if you know the solution to a problem but you are not
      able to communicate and explain it properly to your team then there is no
      point of the solution.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Action Plan:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I took part in meetings actively and I did not shy away in speaking and
      sharing my point of view this improved my communication skills.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Measure of success:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I saw a rise in my confidence and now I can communicate in a professional
      way and also express myself in the best possible way with to-the-point
      words and explanations. My colleagues were really impressed with it
      because I was able to explain to them very complex issues and bugs in a
      very simple language.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #e73269; font-size: 27px">
      GOAL 4: PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Teamwork
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I wanted to work on a project in a big team. Working with other people
      taught me about how to collaborate and grow together by completing
      individual tasks. Teamwork is critical to succeed at every point of life.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Action Plan:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I made sure to be in constant touch with my team while working on projects
      and I also made sure that I kept updating my team members about where I
      was in the project and I was constantly seeking their guidance. I was also
      a part of major discussions about the projects and I tried to input my
      ideas too.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Measure of success:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      By the end of the work term I was able deliver a project while working in
      a team and solving problems by constant collaboration and planning with my
      team members. When the product was delivered I knew that this was a big
      achievement for me and my team.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #e73269; font-size: 40px">
      <b>CONCLUSION</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      In the past 4 months, I think I have learned a lot and transformed myself
      to get one step closer towards becoming job-ready. All the skills that I
      learned during my work term ranging from API testing, automation testing
      to problem-solving and communication skills will help me to succeed in the
      future. I got confident in testing large-scale software and became very
      detail-oriented and collaborative by working with a lot of people during
      my work term. I am very sure that my testing skills have gotten really
      sharp by now and even my mentor believed in my skills and allowed me to QA
      a project on my own. My constant collaboration with software developers
      taught me so much about frontend/backend architectures along with some iOS
      concepts.
    </p>
