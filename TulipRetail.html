         <h1 style="text-align:center;color: #e73269;font-size:40px"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h1>
         <p style="font-size:20px">Welcome to my Co-op work term report. In this report, I will be discussing my experiences, learnings, goals I completed, challenges that I
             faced, and the cool stuff that I did during my work term. This was my first work term and also this was the first time I ever had a tech
             job so this work term had a very positive impact on me and taught me a lot about the software industry. Being a computer science major
             this experience will play a key part in how I understand major workflows in the tech industry.</p>

         <h1 style="text-align:center;color: #e73269;font-size:40px"><b>EMPLOYER</b></h1>
         <p style="font-size:20px">I was lucky enough to get a co-op position at Tulip Retail this fall. Tulip is a SaaS-based company and its main focus is to transform and have a positive impact on the retail world using its technology. Tulip was founded in 2013 and since then the company has seen massive success.
            The software teams at Tulip consist of all sorts of smart people with different roles and backgrounds like Web Developers, IOS Developers, Quality Assurance engineers, etc. Development plays a key role at Tulip as their products work seamlessly on IOS devices and are also interconnected to their internal 
            softwares which are web-based this allows the retailers to unlock their true potential and customers to have the best retail experience. These ultimate functionality products have impressed a lot of leading retailers like COACH, Chanel Ferragamo, etc. Tulip provides their employees with 4 day work weeks 
            which helps the employees to have a very healthy work-life balance. People at Tulip are the nicest and are always ready to help and support. Tulip has been awarded with some very prestigious awards like Technology fast 500 in North America by Deloitte, One of the best workplaces in technology in Canada 2021,
            and Momentum Canada’s next 100M companies. Tulip’s head office is located in Kitchener, Ontario, but due to the current pandemic situation the work term was fully remote. I worked in the Software Quality Assurance team at Tulip and I was responsible for testing the new frontend/backend features and also for 
            some UI automation scripts.</p>

         <h1 style="text-align:center;color: #e73269;font-size:40px"><b>JOB DESCRIPTION</b></h1>
         <p style="font-size:20px">This fall I got the opportunity to work as a Test Automation Developer at Tulip Retail. The first few weeks of my co-op were for my training where I learned about different strategies and the software which the QA team at tulip uses in order to test the new features. 
            During my training I got knowledge about the concepts of unit testing, smoke testing, regression testing, UI testing, integration testing, and API testing using postman then I learned about the different types of HTTP request methods like GET, POST, DELETE, PUT after that I also got familiar 
            with Azure DevOps Server which made it very easy for me to understand the entire application lifecycle. Once all this was done I got involved in the automation part of my job. I learned about the appium framework and CodeceptJS UI testing framework so that I can develop UI automation tests 
            and improve the current tests. Once my training was done I was working with my mentor closely on the Clienteling app. The Clienteling app by Tulip plays an important role in bringing the customers and brands closer by providing the customers with a tailored customer experience and also allows 
            the brands to better understand their customers which benefits both parties. It was the biggest and a very major project that I worked on. I was working closely with 2 IOS developers and a front-end developer to understand what the new features will be and how they will be working and integrated 
            together. I had to constantly plan the test cases beforehand because it was a complex feature and on-spot planning could have led to some unfound bugs and other issues. As the new features were being added the UI constantly changed which affected the UI selectors of the app on which the automation 
            relied on, so along with my colleagues I had to work on the automation scripts regularly in order to modify the code to allow the test suites to run seamlessly every day reducing a manual regression task for the QA team. Two very interesting things that happened with me were that after some time my 
            mentor realized that I was capable enough of being the only QA in the Ferragamo development team allowing other QAs to take up other tasks and speed up the workflow. So for more than 2 months, I was the only person who everyone relied upon before releasing the feature and one mistake by me could have 
            caused unexpected feature behaviors due to some missed bug and product delivery delays which could have affected the business. I was also a part of the company’s co-op hiring process for the next work term which gave me an insight into how the new employees are hired and what all are the main qualities 
            that are the most valued and how to properly structure a resume. For this job, at the very start, I had to be very detail-oriented and have some kind of knowledge about software testing along with some development and version control experiences which I learned while doing my university assignments and 
            while talking to professors and the TAs during the classes and labs. Acquiring the most appropriate skills for this job was covered during the training as a majority of the crucial testing concepts and frameworks could only be learned while working with large-scale systems and software.
