         <h1 style="text-align:center;color: #e73269;font-size:40px"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h1>
         <p style="font-size:20px">Welcome to my Co-op work term report. In this report, I will be discussing my experiences, learnings, goals I completed, challenges that I
             faced, and the cool stuff that I did during my work term. This was my first work term and also this was the first time I ever had a tech
             job so this work term had a very positive impact on me and taught me a lot about the software industry. Being a computer science major
             this experience will play a key part in how I understand major workflows in the tech industry.</p>

         <h1 style="text-align:center;color: #e73269;font-size:40px"><b>EMPLOYER</b></h1>
         <p style="font-size:20px">I was lucky enough to get a co-op position at Tulip Retail this fall. Tulip is a SaaS-based company and its main focus is to transform and have a positive impact on the retail world using its technology. Tulip was founded in 2013 and since then the company has seen massive success.
            The software teams at Tulip consist of all sorts of smart people with different roles and backgrounds like Web Developers, IOS Developers, Quality Assurance engineers, etc. Development plays a key role at Tulip as their products work seamlessly on IOS devices and are also interconnected to their internal 
            softwares which are web-based this allows the retailers to unlock their true potential and customers to have the best retail experience. These ultimate functionality products have impressed a lot of leading retailers like COACH, Chanel Ferragamo, etc. Tulip provides their employees with 4 day work weeks 
            which helps the employees to have a very healthy work-life balance. People at Tulip are the nicest and are always ready to help and support. Tulip has been awarded with some very prestigious awards like Technology fast 500 in North America by Deloitte, One of the best workplaces in technology in Canada 2021,
            and Momentum Canada’s next 100M companies. Tulip’s head office is located in Kitchener, Ontario, but due to the current pandemic situation the work term was fully remote. I worked in the Software Quality Assurance team at Tulip and I was responsible for testing the new frontend/backend features and also for 
            some UI automation scripts.</p>
