      This is my co-op work term report. This report has all the information
      about my 2nd summer co-op work term at Tulip Retail. This report will tell
      you about all my learnings, experiences, and knowledge gained by me during
      this work term. This was the 2nd time I worked at Tulip Retail so during
      this work term I really took deep dive into advanced testing-related
      tasks. Overall this work term made me push my limits and allowed me to be

      <b>EMPLOYER</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      This summer, I was fortunate enough to be reoffered a co-op position at
      Tulip Retail. Tulip is a SaaS-based business whose major goal is to use
      technology to improve and alter the retail industry. Since its founding in
      2013, Tulip has had tremendous success. The software teams at Tulip are
      made up of a diverse group of intelligent individuals with a variety of
      experiences and job titles, including quality assurance specialists, IOS
      developers, DevOps engineers, and web developers. The full integration of
      Tulip's products with IOS smartphones and their web-based internal
      software systems allows merchants to realize the full potential of their
      businesses while providing customers with the greatest possible shopping
      experience. Many prestigious brands, including Salvatore Ferragamo,
      Michael Kors, Tory Burch, and others, have expressed their admiration for
      these advanced applications developed by Tulip Retail. Tulip offers their
      staff four-day work weeks, allowing for a very comfortable working
      environment. The Tulip staff is the friendliest and most willing to
      assist. One of Canada's finest workplaces for technology in 2021, Momentum
      Canada's Next 100M Companies, and Technology Fast 500 in North America by
      Deloitte are just a few of the outstanding honors given to Tulip. Although
      the job was done entirely remotely during the present pandemic situation,
      Tulip's corporate office is in Kitchener, Ontario. Working for Tulip, I
      was a member of the software quality assurance group also in addition to
      automation scripts, I was in charge of testing the new frontend/backend
      functionality.

      <b>JOB DESCRIPTION</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      This summer I worked as a test automation developer at Tulip Retail for
      the second time. I was part of the quality assurance team and I worked
      closely with both manual and automation testers. I was constantly working
      on Tulip's biggest and the most complex application throughout the work
      term. I was writing automation scripts for the application on which I was
      working on. As the application I was working on was already very large and
      it was expanding rapidly so it was very hard to manually test everything,
      so along with me, there were other automation developers who were
      constantly working on the application as a team. We were writing
      automation scripts to test new features as well as the old features as a
      part of regression testing which were deployed everday and gave us an idea
      about what was breaking and what was working fine. The most interesting
      task that I did during my work term would be refactoring major automation
      suites all by myself. So I had to go through almost the whole automation
      codebase and then I had to find areas that could be improved or if they
      were unnecessary. This was one of the most challenging tasks during my
      co-op. Another unique part of my job was that I was also doing manual
      testing if any of the team members were on leave for some time, this made
      me work for 2 teams under the quality assurance department which means
      that I was sometimes handling 2 different job positions at once. Since I
      had already done a co-op at Tulip retail in the past so I knew about most
      of the skills that were necessary for the job, but still skills like
      knowledge about different concepts like unit testing, smoke testing,
      regression testing, UI testing, integration testing, API testing using
      postman, Azure DevOps server to understand application lifecycle and some
      experience with any automation framework are the ones that one should have
      some idea about before starting the job. Most of these skills I learned
      myself while making projects and testing them and I learned some on the
      job. Since I haven't taken a testing course at the University so I trained
      myself with help of the internet and my colleagues at the workplace.

      <b>GOALS</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      Before starting my work term I had set a few goals in my mind which I
      wanted to achieve by the end of my work term. These goals allowed me to
      work hard and be a better learner and employee by the end of my work term.
      Here are my goals for this work term and how I achieved these goals.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #e73269; font-size: 27px">
      GOAL 1: PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Personal Organization/Time
      Management
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      As I worked in 2 teams which were the manual testing team and the
      automation development team so I wanted to learn about how to organize my
      work and manage my time appropriately for each team.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Action Plan:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I talked to my manager and I made a rough estimate of how much work I
      would have during the week and I added timelines to my calendar and made
      sure to stick to those timelines and I tried to organize my work and
      managed my time appropriately to complete my tasks.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Measure of success:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I was able to stick to the timelines that I made and I made sure to
      deliver my tasks from both the teams on time without hurrying to finish
      them, by working in a very organized way. This is how I was successful in
      achieveing my goal.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #e73269; font-size: 27px">
      GOAL 2: COMMUNICATING - Reading Comprehension
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I had a lot of coding to do during this term so I wanted to improve upon
      on my reading comprehension because I was expected to be able to read a
      lot of code as well as a lot of documentation.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Action Plan:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I tried to go through more and more of already written code as this gave
      me an idea of how to go over and read large codebases. I had also spent a
      lot of time in reading documentation as this gave me an idea about how
      documentations are meant to be read.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Measure of success:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I was able to interpret the documenation properly and understand the
      codebase and contribute to that codebase. This is how I felt that I was
      successful in achieveing my goal.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #e73269; font-size: 27px">
      GOAL 3: CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Inquiry & Analysis
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      As I had to go through a lot of code and new application versions
      regularly so I wanted to improve upon my analysis skills to better
      understand how everything worked by constantly inquiring about things.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Action Plan:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I constantly tried to understand each line of code to better analyze the
      codebase and I inquired about the things that I did not understand from my
      team members, this created a habit of inquiring and analysing in me while
      reading and writing code.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #e73269">Measure of success:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      By the end of the work term I was able to analyse large codebases and
      applications and I understood how to properly inquire about technical
      terms from my teammates. This is how I felt that I was successful in
      achieveing my goal.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #e73269; font-size: 40px">
      <b>CONCLUSION</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      This co-op work term will have a very big impact on my knowledge and
      skills. This work term was the first time when I worked like a full-time
      professional without a lot of help from other team members. During this
      term, I got well versed with the automation frameworks like appium and I
      also refreshed my manual testing skills. Along with all the technical
      skills, I also learned how to use critical thinking during high-pressure
      situations and how to communicate with other team members to get the tasks
      completed. During the meetings and when collaborating with the developers
      I learned a lot about web and app development. This work term made me
      confident about my skills and now I can do testing and write automation
      scripts on large applications.
    </p>
