      Welcome to my co-op work term report for NCR Corporation! Here, I'll talk
      about my time, what I learned, the goals I achieved, the challenges I
      faced, and the cool things I did during my work term. This was my 3rd and
      4th co-op term, and it was the most challenging software job I've had so
      far. Working at NCR Corporation was an amazing experience that taught me a
      lot about software development. As a computer science major, it helped me
      understand what actual and high level backend development is. Let's
      explore my journey at NCR together!

      <b>JOB DESCRIPTION</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      As a Software Developer - Backend co-op at NCR Corporation, my role was
      crucial in creating innovative technology solutions. I was responsible for
      designing and implementing robust backend systems and applications that
      powered NCR's software. I collaborated with talented teams of frontend
      developers, product managers, and quality assurance professionals, and we
      worked together to deliver high-quality and scalable solutions for various
      industries. My role also involved designing and developing APIs to support
      our software applications and services. Working in collaboration with
      frontend developers, I ensured a smooth integration between user
      interfaces and backend functionality. Additionally, I handled implementing
      data storage solutions and optimizing database performance to ensure
      efficient data retrieval and storage. By closely working with product
      managers, I gained a comprehensive understanding of project requirements
      and how to translate them into technical specifications. I actively
      participated in code reviews, testing, and debugging processes to maintain
      high code quality and promptly resolve any issues that may arise. To stay
      ahead in the workplace, I constantly kept myself updated with the latest
      technologies and industry trends, bringing innovative ideas to enhance
      NCR's products. My passion lies in continuously improving and optimizing
      existing software components to achieve better performance and
      maintainability for the software solutions. During my NCR internship, I
      very closely worked with two talented Software Development Engineers (SDE1
      and SDE2). They provided valuable guidance and support, boosting my
      confidence and improving my technical skills. Their mentorship left a
      lasting impact, inspiring me to foster a collaborative and supportive work
      environment. I am grateful for the experience and eager to use it forward
      in my future career. As a software development intern at NCR, I needed to
      be proficient in DevOps tools like Jenkins and Docker for CI/CD
      automation. My backend development skills included Java and Spring Boot
      for scalable systems. Additionally, I accuired the skills like,
      integrating YAML configurations into REST APIs and modernizing Spring Boot
      and JDK dependencies. Troubleshooting skills were crucial for identifying
      and resolving issues efficiently. Proficiency in Git for version control
      and strong collaboration abilities were essential skills for this role.
      Analytical thinking was vital for problem-solving and improving system
      performance. I possessed certain skills from my university education,
      while others were acquired through hands-on learning in the workplace.

      <b>GOALS</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      Before starting my work term I had set a few goals in my mind which I
      wanted to achieve by the end of my work term. These goals allowed me to
      work hard and be a better learner and employee by the end of my term. Here
      are my goals for this work term and how I achieved these goals.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #14ee22; font-size: 27px">
      GOAL 1: PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Personal Organization/Time
      Management
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      As I was working with backend software development teams so I wanted to
      learn about how to organize my work and manage my time appropriately for
      each task.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #14ee22">Action Plan:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I talked to my manager and I made a rough estimate of how much work I had
      during the week and added timelines to my calendar and made sure to stick
      to those timelines and I tried to organize my work and manage my time
      appropriately to complete my tasks.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #14ee22">Measure of success:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I was able to stick to the timelines that I made and I made sure to
      deliver my tasks for both the teams I worked with on time without hurrying
      to finish them by working in a very organized way. I think I was
      successful in achieveing this goal of mine.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #14ee22; font-size: 27px">
      COMMUNICATING - Reading Comprehension
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      As I had to do a lot of coding in this term so I wanted to improve upon on
      my reading comprehension because I had to read a lot of code as well as a
      lot of documentation.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #14ee22">Action Plan:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I tried to go through more and more of already written code as this gave
      me an idea of how to go over and read large codebases. I also spent a lot
      of time in reading documentation as this also gave an idea about how
      documentation are meant to be read.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #14ee22">Measure of success:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I was able to interpret the documenation properly and understand the
      codebase and contribute to the codebase. I read a lot of code to
      understand the flow and I regularly took help from my teammates to
      understand more about the documentation and the code logic.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; color: #14ee22; font-size: 27px">
      CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Inquiry & Analysis
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      As I had to go through a lot of existing code and new code versions
      regularly, so, I wanted to improve upon my analysing skills to better
      understand how everything worked by constantly inquiring about things.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #14ee22">Action Plan:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I constantly tried to understand each line of code to better analyse the
      codebase and I inquired about the things that I did not understand, from
      my team members, this created a habit of inquiring and analysing in me
      while reading and writing code.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 23px; color: #14ee22">Measure of success:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      I am able to analyse large codebases and how the applications are built
      upon them and how they are using that code. I was able to do analysis on
      how multiple code files talk to each other. This helped me to analyse
      overall flow of many services.
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #14ee22; font-size: 40px">
      <b>CONCLUSION</b>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px">
      In the past 8 months, I think I have learned a lot and transformed myself
      to get one step closer towards becoming a better software developer. All
      the skills that I learned during my work term ranging from
      backend-development, Devops to product ownership will help me to succeed
      as a developer. I got confident in developing large-scale software and
      became very independent and detail-oriented by working with a lot of teams
      during my work term. I am very sure that my development skills have gotten
      really sharp by now.
